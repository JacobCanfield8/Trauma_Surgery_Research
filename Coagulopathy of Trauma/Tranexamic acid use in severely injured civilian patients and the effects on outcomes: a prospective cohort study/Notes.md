# Notes

- Tranexamic acid (TXA) has had variable results in major hemorrhage protocols (MHP) in civilian settings
- No overall change in outcome in shocked/ non-shocked patients
- TXA associated with reduction in multiple organ failure (MOF) and protective for all-cause mortality in shocked patients
- Especially beneficial for shocked and severely injured patients
- Only really one major large multi-center randomized control trial
- Associated with increased survival in military setting
- "However, the uptake of TXA use in civilian trauma has been variable, in part due to the difficulty in translating the results of these studies to mature trauma systems, with differences in study populations, logistics, and resource availability. This evidence gap in the civilian experience is limiting the widespread use of TXA and its potential benefits on
survival."
- Need for determination of which patient groups would benefit from TXA the most
- Also study of non-mortality outcomes and adverse effects need investigation
- This paper found no clear evidence of benefit for non-shocked pt, however, no evidence of increased complications noted
- Shocked patients had improved outcomes with mortality and MOF
- Protective of early mortality, however, some late mortality still seen, however, these pt had lowers SBP on arrival and larger transfusion requirements
- Reduced rates of respiratory failure in shocked pt that received TXA
- Single and MOF may be d/t anti-inflammatory effects of TXA on plasmin production (proinflammatory)
- Base deficit (BD) used as marker of tissue hypoperfusion --> systemic hypoperfusion --> drives fibrinolysis in trauma
- BD as POC testing is not uncommon but delays administration of TXA. BP, however, is also known to be a poor indicator of degree of systemic hypoperfusion
- CRASH2 used SBP <75 mmHg but this would miss large # pts
- More work to determine clinically importat markers associated with fibrinolysis and TXA indications needed
- Clear use of TXA indicated in severely injured and shocked pt, gray area cases is where more work needs to be done
