# Notes

- Tranexamic acid (TXA) has had variable results in major hemorrhage protocols (MHP) in civilian settings
- No overall change in outcome in shocked/ non-shocked patients
- TXA associated with reduction in multiple organ failure (MOF) and protective for all-cause mortality in shocked patients
- Especially beneficial for shocked and severely injured patients
- Only really one major large multi-center randomized control trial
- Associated with increased survival in military setting
- "However, the uptake of TXA use in civilian trauma has been variable, in part due
to the difficulty in translating the results of these studies to mature
trauma systems, with differences in study populations, logistics, and
resource availability. This evidence gap in the civilian experience
is limiting the widespread use of TXA and its potential benefits on
survival."
