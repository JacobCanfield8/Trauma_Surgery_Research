# Age Guidelines For Limiting Resuscitation Thoracotomy Mortality


## Background

- Exploratative/ Resuscitative Thoracotomy is a life saving procedure in trauma setting
    - What is procedure & how is it done
        - RT is a salvage surgery performed with the goal of locating and controlling exsanguinating bleeding in the thorax. Additionally, access to the heart to correct cardiac tamponade and exploration of the diaphragm to identify diaphragmatic injury (DI) can be accomplished (Mitchell et. al). This requires patient to go under general anesthesia in the operating room (OR). The patient has antiseptic skin preparation applied and is draped. A left mammary anterolateral thoracotomy is made from the sternal margin to the axillary fossa. From this point the incision can be extended to a bilateral thoracotomy, also referred to as a clam-shell thoracotomy, which can be performed when access to right side of thorax or mediastinal structures need to be addressed. 
    - How effective is it
        - As mentioned by Mitchell et. al, civilian literature indicates a survival rate of 1-2% for blunt traumas and 11-16% for penetrating trauma.
    - Why is it done/ goals/ expectations/ outcomes
        - RT is performed with the objective of controlling extsanguinating bleeding from the heart, lungs or major vessels, decompression of pericardial tamponade, prevent blood loss infradiaphragmatically, cross-clamping the descending thoracic aorta or initiating internal cardiac massage. 
    - Historical
        - 
- Current guidelines and indications East and West
- Propose addition of use of age related mortality marker into guidelines



## Abstract

Resuscitative Thoracotomy (RT) is a potentially life saving intervention that is important in the setting of trauma to the thorax. Due to the high mortality rate of this procedure, guidelines are continuously being evolved to provide a framework for practictioners to determine whether RT is warranted for a given case. Many of the guidelines currently in place involve factors such as mechanism of injurt (MOI) i.e. blunt or penetrating, minutes of CPR performed prior to arrival at the emergency department (ED) and signs of life (SOL). The two major institutions creating these guidelines are the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Western Trauma Association. Currently, neither of these institutions provide guidelines regarding the efficacy of RT on the grounds of age. In this work we aim to establish an age based mortality threshold above which RT is contraindicated based on mortality statistics using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). 



## Methods

- Obtain NTDB data

![NTDB](https://www.facs.org/media/pblldi2b/2023-data-dictionary-cover.jpg)
- Analysis of dataset broadly/ demographics/ where data comes from/ datafields available
- Isolate cases in which Thoracotomy was performed
- Create graph of age vs. mortality
- Use statistical analysis to determine threshold age for which thoracotomy is no longer recommended
- Explore stratification/ secondary factors in addition to age that may additionally influence mortality threshold
    - For example, is the threshold same in males and females,
