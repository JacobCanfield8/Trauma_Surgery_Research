## Abstract

Resuscitative Thoracotomy (RT) is a potentially life saving intervention that is important in the setting of trauma to the thorax. Due to the high mortality rate of this procedure, guidelines are continuously being evolved to provide a framework for practictioners to determine whether RT is warranted for a given case. Many of the guidelines currently in place involve factors such as mechanism of injurt (MOI) i.e. blunt or penetrating, minutes of CPR performed prior to arrival at the emergency department (ED) and signs of life (SOL). The two major institutions creating these guidelines are the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Western Trauma Association. Currently, neither of these institutions provide guidelines regarding the efficacy of RT on the grounds of age. In this work we aim to establish an age based mortality threshold above which RT is contraindicated based on mortality statistics using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). 



## Methods

- Obtain NTDB data

![NTDB](https://www.facs.org/media/pblldi2b/2023-data-dictionary-cover.jpg)
- Analysis of dataset broadly/ demographics/ where data comes from/ datafields available
- Isolate cases in which Thoracotomy was performed
- Create graph of age vs. mortality
- Use statistical analysis to determine threshold age for which thoracotomy is no longer recommended
- Explore stratification/ secondary factors in addition to age that may additionally influence mortality threshold
    - For example, is the threshold same in males and females,
