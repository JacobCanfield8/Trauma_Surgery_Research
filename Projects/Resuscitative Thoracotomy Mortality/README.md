# Age Guidelines For Limiting Resuscitation Thoracotomy Mortality

## Background

- Exploratative/ Resuscitative Thoracotomy is a life saving procedure in trauma setting
    - What is procedure
    - How is it done
    - How effective is it
    - Why is it done/ goals/ expectations/ outcomes
    - Variations
    - Historical
- Current guidelines and indications East and West
- Propose addition of use of age related mortality marker into guidelines



## Methods

- Obtain NTDB data

![NTDB] (https://www.facs.org/media/pblldi2b/2023-data-dictionary-cover.jpg)
- Analysis of dataset broadly/ demographics/ where data comes from/ datafields available
- Isolate cases in which Thoracotomy was performed
- Create graph of age vs. mortality
- Use statistical analysis to determine threshold age for which thoracotomy is no longer recommended
- Explore stratification/ secondary factors in addition to age that may additionally influence mortality threshold
    - For example, is the threshold same in males and females,
