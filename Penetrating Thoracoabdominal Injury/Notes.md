# Notes

- Penetrating thoracoabdominal stab wounds (SW) present "Double Jeopardy" situation due to injury to two cavities
- Important to determine which (or both) cavity/s need to be operated on (high complication rate if done non-therapeutically)
- Large proportion diaphragmatic injuries (DI) (~32%) were undetected on CT
- The order in which thoracotamy or laparotomy is done is important, especially if cardiac injurt suspected
    - In this case, thoractomy should be first to rule out major vessel damage in thorax
- Surgeon ultrasound has near 100% sensitivity and selectivity for identifying major cardiac vessel/ cardiac injury
- Important to retain patients for observation for at least 12 hours and watch for peritoneal/ mediastinal bleeding before clearing
    - If patients become unstable --> exploratory thoracotomy and possible laparotomy
- ". In stable patients, laparoscopy remains essential for the
identification of occult DI. In unstable patients, correct sequencing of cavitary intervention, depending primarily on exclusion of cardiac injury, is paramount. For those patients
arriving alive who manifest ongoing hemodynamic instability
but equivocal clinical and ultrasonographic evidence of cardiac injury, initial laparotomy, followed by transdiaphragmatic
pericardial window if no causative injury is found, is likely the
most efficacious strategy."
