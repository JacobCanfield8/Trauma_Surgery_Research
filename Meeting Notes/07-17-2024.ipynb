    "\n",
    "**Main Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore by Age --> Hospital Type/ Location --> blunt/ penetrating\n",
    "- Explore outcomes (los, icu, # of procedures, complications, hospital events)\n",
    "- Do stats to determine if there are any statistical points\n",
    "- Compare with Loyola paper for stats ideas\n",
    "- Predict other outcomes other than mortality with ML\n",
    "- Keep working on reducing ML features to a few things\n",
    "- Seems like there is no clear age contraindication\n",
    "- Make sure all of the code works, annotate, convert to functions etc. (see if there is a way to make it into a package/ API)\n",
    "- Compare/ contrast with EAST guidelines (SOL and pulseless)\n",
    "- Try running the pipeline with with both ICD-10 and HMRRHGCTRLSURG cases\n",
    "- Consider using old and new data for the ML because only need a few fields and it seems like they would be reasonably consistent\n",
    "- Make it so that the ML thing works similar to med calc (convert numerical data into being more categorical?)\n",
    "- Switch to first 15 minutes as a cutoff (same as Loyola paper)\n",
    "- Also look at fluids given with outcomes etc.\n",
    "- When testing ML should compare with random guessing performance but also performance if you just assume all outcomes are Expired (overfitting/ not differentiating)"
