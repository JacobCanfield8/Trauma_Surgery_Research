# Notes

- Military settings, rural, civilian settings without rapid access to hemmorhage control
- Current Advanced Trauma Life Support reccomends compression as first line hemorrhage control, however, for some injuries this may be more time consuming and less effective than applying a tourniquet
- Especially in rural settings with long Pre-hospital transport times tourniquet is tool of choice
- Tourniquet use inidicated by military because of the number of soldiers that died d/t exsanguination solely d/t extremity vascular injury
- Tactical Combat Casualty care pre-hospital system developed --> Indicates use of tourniquets
- Potentially up to 57% of cardiac arrest pt following penetrating extremity injury preventable with use of tourniquets early in treatment
- Blunt mechanisms of injury have not been a focus of studies with tourniquet use, primarily focus on penetrating trauamas
- THIS STUDY LIMITED ONLY N=4 FOR TOURNIQUET APPLIED OF 190 PT INCLUDED
- All of the tourniquets used in this study were improvised tourniquets
- Most of the patients with arterial injuries had contained hematomas
- Did note that transfusion requirements were higher in pt without tourniquet application
- Study needs higher sample size overall to make better conclusions
- This is a Canadian study from 2014, seems at the time they had not adopted CAT/ TQ use for civilian use
- It seems the debate is the use of TQ in civilian setting more so than their efficacy as the military where a high volume of these injuries are present seems to unanimously agree that they are effective and beneficial given the circumstances of the battlefield setting which is different in both MOI and transport times when compared to civlian applications
