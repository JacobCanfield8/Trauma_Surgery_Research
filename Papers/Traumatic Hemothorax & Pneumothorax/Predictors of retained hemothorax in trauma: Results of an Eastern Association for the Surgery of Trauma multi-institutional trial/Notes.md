# Notes

- acute hemothorax (HTX) one of most common findings in pt with blunt or penetrating trauma to thorax
- Often associated with rib Fx, pulmonary contusion, PTX, and diaphragmatic injury (DI)
    - Many of these can be managed w/ NOM via observation or tube thoracostomy
    - Incomplete HTX eval can lead to retained HTX (RH)
        - Independently predicts complications:
            - empyema
            - PNA
            - Prolonged admission duration
- Bedside drainage via Yankauer suction device (YATS) and irrigation chest cavity with warm saline
- Larger HTX on admission associated with higher rates of RH on CT
- 15% increase in risk for RH with each 100 mL of HTX on initial CT
- initial tube thoracostomy size not associated with development RH
- RH pt had worse outcomes, increased time in ICU and hospital LOS, increased rates PNA and longer time on ventilator
- RH is approximately 29% of thoracic injury
- RH has risks of empyema and fibrothorax
- If admission HTX <300 mL, less likely to develop an RH
- Could use initial HTX volume on CT to stratify patient need for early surgical intervention or VATS
- Tube size for thoracostomy did not have major impact on risk for RH so further investigation into use of smaller caliber tube/ catheter should be explored
- Optimal management strategies warrranted for improved mitigation of RH in high risk pt
