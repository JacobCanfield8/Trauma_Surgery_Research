# Notes

- Majority of MVC occur in rural setting
- These pt have double the mortality of their urban counterparts
- Sometimes these pt are stabilized at tertiary center before being transported to level 1 center
- This study looks at whether damage control laparotomy in pre-transport setting to level 1 center is beneficial
- 61% fatal MVC in rural setting
- Installment of regional trauma centers to transfer complex patients to has improved mortality
- Damage control laparotomy (DCL) can be performed prior to transfer from rural setting
- Pt requiring DCL often seriously injured have metabolic and hemodynamic instability
- In this study 12/14 pt who DID NOT undergo DCL succumbed to hemorrhage
- 14/17 pt that underwent DCL and packing remained stable, only one succumbed to hemorrhage
- Pt that underwent DCL had significant disturbances in pH and PTT --> inability to correct this led to higher mortality
    - 4.43 for every 0.1 drop in pH
    - 9.4 for pt with a PTT> 80s
- Criteria for selecting pt:
    - Instability indicated by:
        - Hypotension
        - Tachycardia
        - AMS
        - Progressive coagulopathy
        - Acidosis
        - Hypothermia
- Mortality was nearly 66% when acidosis and coagulopathy were not corrected prior to definitive repair, motivating the idea that DCL should almost be performed to directly address these insults
- Abdominal packing and ICU resuscitation with staged repair of injury
- 3 stage approach:
    1. Immediate laparotomy performed with rapid abdominal packing and temporary closure
    2. Physiologic stabilization in ICU with tertiary exam
    3. Definitive repair of injuries AFTER stabilization
- Goal of DCL is to buy time for unstable pt in rural setting to make it to primary higher level center to perform definitive repair
- 58% --> 90% survival rate for penetrating abdominal injury when performing DCL
- Studies have shown that duration of time that pt is acidotic, coagulopathic, hypothermic and hemorrhaging negatively affect survival
