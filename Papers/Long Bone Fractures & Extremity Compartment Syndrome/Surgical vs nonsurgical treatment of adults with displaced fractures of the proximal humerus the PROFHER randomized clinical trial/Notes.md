# Notes

- Need for Sx in majority of pt with displace prox humeral fx unclear
- Interventions included both Surgical and Non-surgical interventions
- Surgical:
    - Fx fixation
    - Humeral head replacement
- Non-surgical:
    - Sling immobilization
- Standard outpt rehab provided to both groups
- No significant difference in Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) over 2 years b/t surgical and non-surgical group
- "Among patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the surgical neck, there was no significant difference between surgical treatment compared with nonsurgical treatm ent in patient-reported clinical outcomes over 2 years
following fracture occurrence. These results do not support the trend of increased surgery for patients with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus."
- These fx usually happen in pt >65 y/o and largely attributable to osteoporotic changes
- The incidence of this demographic having these fx is increasing
- Majority involve the surgical neck of the humerus
