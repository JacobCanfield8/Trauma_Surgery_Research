# Notes

- Blunt Cerebrovascular Injuries (BCVIs) associated with significant morbidity and mortality
- This paper evaluates guidelines for dx and mgmt including screening protocols, criteria for c-spine eval and use of antithrombotic therapy (ATT) and endovascular stents
- Recommend using screening protocol to detect BCVI in poly trauma pt
- Screening CT angiography recommended when high risk C-spine injuries present
    - Conditionally recommended for low risk C-spine injuries
- ATT recommended for pt dx w/ Grades II and III BCVIs
- BCVIs are rare
    - Most feared complication is stroke, up to 20% of pt and more common in elderly within first 72 hrs
- Early administrartion of ATT reduces risk of stroke
- "Future studies should attempt to identify optimal screening criteria, with a more accurate estimate of the yield of various
injury mechanisms and patterns. The search for the ideal screening test continues, and modalities such as whole-body CT scan
should be further evaluated. In terms of ATT, future studies should compare therapies, and consider costs, duration, and need for follow-up imaging. The safety and optimal timing of initiation of ATT in patients with TBI and solid organ injuries remains to be defined. The role of endovascular stenting and other interventions (e.g., angioembolization) must be further clarified."
